  # You can use shifts to make sure the bot is not suspicious because it is too

  # typing and delay.
  #
  # For example, if you would like to have to bot on for 6 hours per day, then
  # inactive for the remaining 18 you would do something like this (note that
  # it will loop this, so after completing the last shift it will go back to the
  # first):
  #
  #   - state: "active"
  #     duration:
  #       base: 21600
  #       variance: 0
  #   - state: "dormant"
  #     duration:
  #       base: 64800
  #       variance: 0
  #
  # A base duration of -1 means indefinite. This will be displayed as a large
  # amount of hours when running the application due to limitations.
