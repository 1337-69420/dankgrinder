#
# You can use shifts to make sure the bot is not suspicious because it is too
# active. Base and variance are in seconds and work the same as they do with
# typing and delay.
#
# For example, if you would like to have the bot be active for 6 hours per day,
# then inactive for the remaining 18 you would do something like this (note
# that it will loop this, so after completing the last shift it will go back
# to the first):
#
#  shifts:
#     - state: "active"
#       duration:
#         base: 21600
#         variance: 0
#     - state: "dormant"
#       duration:
#         base: 64800
#         variance: 0
#
# A base duration of -1 means indefinite. This will be displayed as a large
# amount of hours when running the application due to limitations.
#
# You should configure at least 1 instance. An instance requires a token, a
# channel id and at least 1 shift. You may configure multiple instances to run
# more than 1 bot at a time. Some extra instructions are provided at
# https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder#configuration
